    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Bill';
    console.log(team, players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const slicing = players.slice();
    slicing[3] = 'Hugh Slice';
    console.log(slicing);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const concating = [].concat(players);
    concating[3] = 'Julius Concat';
    console.log(concating);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const spreading = [...players];
    spreading[3] = 'Hanibal Spread';
    console.log(spreading);

    // or use Array.from()
    const arrFrom = Array.from(players);
    arrFrom[3] = 'Robert Array From';
    console.log(arrFrom);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Joao', age: 26 });
    console.log(newPerson);
    console.log(person);

    // Object ...spread
    const objSpread = {...person};
    console.log(objSpread);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
